# Git Operations

Handles git workflow operations: branch creation, committing, and pushing. Enforces naming conventions and commit message standards.

## When to Use

- Creating a new feature/bugfix branch from a ticket key
- Committing changes with a properly formatted message
- Pushing a branch to origin
- Checking current git status

## Procedure

### Creating a Branch

1. Run the git helper script:
   ```bash
   python3 ./.github/skills/git-operations/scripts/git_helper.py create-branch <TICKET_KEY> <TYPE>
   ```
   Reference: [git_helper.py](./scripts/git_helper.py)

2. **Branch naming convention:**
   - Format: `<type>/<ticket-key-lowercase>`
   - Examples: `feat/proj-123`, `fix/proj-456`, `chore/proj-789`
   - Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`

3. The script will:
   - Pull latest from the default branch (main/master)
   - Create and checkout the new branch
   - If the branch already exists, check it out instead

### Committing Changes

1. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 ./.github/skills/git-operations/scripts/git_helper.py commit "<MESSAGE>"
   ```

2. **Commit message format:** Follow the rules in [`commit-conventions.instructions.md`](../../instructions/commit-conventions.instructions.md).

3. **Commit strategy — atomic commits:**
   - One commit per logical change (not per file)
   - Each commit should be independently buildable
   - Group related changes: e.g., new function + its tests = one commit
   - Separate refactoring from feature work

### Pushing

1. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 ./.github/skills/git-operations/scripts/git_helper.py push
   ```

2. Sets upstream tracking automatically on first push.

### Checking Status

1. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 ./.github/skills/git-operations/scripts/git_helper.py status
   ```

2. Shows: current branch, upstream tracking, ahead/behind counts, changed files.

## Important

- Always create a branch before making changes — never commit to main/master directly
- Ensure the branch name includes the ticket key for traceability
- Write commit messages that explain **why**, not just **what**
- If committing on behalf of a workflow, include the ticket key in the commit footer
